# gRPC Stats

Any particular library might provide only a subset of these measures/views/tags.
Check the language-specific documentation for the list of supported values.

## Units

As always, units are encoded according to the case-sensitive abbreviations from the [Unified Code for Units of Measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html):

* Latencies are measures in float64 milliseconds, denoted "ms"
* Sizes are measured in bytes, denoted "By"
* Counts of messages per RPC have unit "1"

Buckets for distributions in default views are as follows:

* Size in bytes: 0, 1024, 2048, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, 1048576, 4194304, 16777216, 67108864, 268435456, 1073741824, 4294967296
* Latency in ms: 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 65, 80, 100, 130, 160, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 650, 800, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000
* Counts (no unit): 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536

## Terminology

* **RPC** single call against a gRPC service, either streaming or unary.
* **message** individual message in an RPC. Streaming RPCs can have multiple messages per RPC. Unary RPCs always have only a single message per RPC.
* **status** string (all caps), e.g. CANCELLED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED. See: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

## Client

### Measures

Client stats are recorded at the end of each outbound RPC.

| Measure name                             | Unit | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| grpc.io/client/sent_messages_per_rpc     | 1    | Number of messages sent in the RPC (always 1 for non-streaming RPCs).                         |
| grpc.io/client/sent_bytes_per_rpc        | By   | Total bytes sent across all request messages per RPC.                                         |
| grpc.io/client/received_messages_per_rpc | 1    | Number of response messages received per RPC (always 1 for non-streaming RPCs).               |
| grpc.io/client/received_bytes_per_rpc    | By   | Total bytes received across all response messages per RPC.                                    |
| grpc.io/client/roundtrip_latency         | ms   | Time between first byte of request sent to last byte of response received, or terminal error. |
| grpc.io/client/server_latency            | ms   | Propagated from the server and should have the same value as "grpc.io/server/latency".        |

### Tags

All client metrics should be tagged with the following. 

| Tag name           | Description                                                                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| grpc_client_method | Full gRPC method name, including package, service and method, e.g. google.bigtable.v2.Bigtable/CheckAndMutateRow |
| grpc_client_status | gRPC server status code received, e.g. OK, CANCELLED, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED                                          |

`grpc_client_method` is set when an outgoing request starts and is available in all the recorded
metrics. 
`grpc_client_status` is set when an outgoing request finishes and is only available around metrics
recorded at the end of the outgoing request.
Status codes should be stringified according to:
https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

### Default views

The following set of views are considered minimum required to monitor client-side performance:

| View name                             | Measure suffix         | Aggregation  | Tags suffix                  |

| grpc.io/client/roundtrip_latency      | roundtrip_latency      | distribution | client_method                |
| grpc.io/client/completed_rpcs         | roundtrip_latency      | count        | client_method, client_status |

### Extra views

The following set of views are considered useful but not mandatory to monitor client side performance:

`grpc_server_method` is set when an incoming request starts and is available in the context for
the entire RPC call handling. 

`grpc_server_status` is set when an incoming request finishes and is only available around metrics
recorded at the end of the incoming request.
Status codes should be stringified according to:
https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/statuscodes.md

## FAQ

### Why different tag name for server/client method?
This way users can configure views to correlate incoming with outgoing requests. A view example:

| View name                               | Measure                          | Aggregation  | Tags suffix                  |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| grpc.io/client/latency_by_server_method | grpc.io/client/roundtrip_latency | distribution | client_method, server_method |

### How is the server latency on the client recorded (grcp.io/client/server_latency)?
This is TBD, eventually a designated gRPC metadata key will be specified for this purpose.

### Why no error counts?
Error counts can be computed on your metrics backend by totalling the different per-status values.

### Why are ".../completed_rpcs" views defined over latency measures?
They can be defined over any measure recorded once per RPC (since it's just a count aggregation over the measure).
It would be unnecessary to use a separate "count" measure.
