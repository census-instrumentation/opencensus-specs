# HTTP Stats

Any particular library might provide only a subset of these measures/views/tags.
Check the language-specific documentation for the list of supported values.

All times (latencies) are measured in float64 fractions of microseconds.

There is no special support for multi-part HTTP requests and responses. These are just treated as one request.

## Units

Units are encoded according to the case-sensitive abbreviations from the [Unified Code for Units of Measure](http://unitsofmeasure.org/ucum.html):

* Latencies are measures in float64 milliseconds, denoted "ms"
* Sizes are measured in bytes, denoted "By"
* Dimensionless values have unit "1"

Buckets for distributions in default views are as follows:

* Size in bytes: 0, 1024, 2048, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, 1048576, 4194304, 16777216, 67108864, 268435456, 1073741824, 4294967296
* Latency in ms: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 65, 80, 100, 130, 160, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 650, 800, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000

## Client

All views, measures and tags should have the prefix: "opencensus.io/http/client". For example: "opencensus.io/http/client/started".

### Measures

Client stats are recorded for each individual HTTP request, including for each redirect (followed or not). 

| Measure suffix                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| opencensus.io/http/client/started_count  | Number of all client requests started                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| opencensus.io/http/client/request_bytes  | Total bytes sent in request body (not including headers). This is uncompressed bytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| opencensus.io/http/client/response_bytes | Total bytes received in response bodies (not including headers but including error responses with bodies). Should be measured from actual bytes received and read, not the value of the Content-Length header. This is uncompressed bytes. Responses with no body should record 0 for this value. |
| opencensus.io/http/client/latency        | Time between first byte of request headers sent to last byte of response received, or terminal error                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Tags

All client metrics should be tagged with the following.

| Tag suffix  | Description                                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| http.method | HTTP method, capitalized (i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)         |
| http.status | HTTP status code, or "error" if no response status line was received |
| http.path   | URL path (not including query string)                                |
| http.host   | Value of the request Host header                                     |

### Default views

The following default views are defined:

| View suffix                                                        | Measure suffix | Aggregation  | Tags                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| opencensus.io/http/client/started_count                            | started_count  | sum          | method, path         |
| opencensus.io/http/client/request_bytes                            | request_bytes  | distribution | method, path         |
| opencensus.io/http/client/response_bytes                           | response_bytes | distribution | method, path         |
| opencensus.io/http/client/latency                                  | latency        | distribution | method, path         |
| opencensus.io/http/client/finished_count                           | latency        | count        | method, path, status |

## Server

TBD but most will mirror client metrics.
