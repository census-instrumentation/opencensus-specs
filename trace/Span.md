# Span API

This class represents a Span. A span contains a SpanContext and  allows users to record 
tracing events based on the data model defined [here](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-proto/blob/master/trace/trace.proto).
All Span implementations MUST not allow users to read the recorded data, 

## Span structure

### SpanContext
Represents all the information that MUST be propagated to child Spans and across process boundaries.
A span context contains the tracing identifiers and the options that are propagated from parent 
to child Spans.

#### TraceId 
Is the identifier for a trace. It is worldwide unique with practically sufficient 
probability by being made as 16 randomly generated bytes. TraceId is used to group all spans for 
a specific trace together across all processes.

#### SpanId 
Is the identifier for a span. It is globally unique with practically sufficient probability by 
being made as 8 randomly generated bytes. When passed to a child Span this identifier becomes the
parent span id for the child Span.

#### TraceOptions 
Represents the options for a trace. It is represented as 1 byte (bitmap).

##### Supported bits
* Sampling bit -  Bit to represent whether trace is sampled or not (mask `0x1`).
